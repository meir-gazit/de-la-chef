# de-la-chef - my imaginary restaurant
de-la-chef is a website I wrote for an imaginary restaurant, the idea was to practice with the help of a react library standard code tasks, 
working with various components of the library and relieving boredom in the days of the Corona (COVID-19) which I spent most of the time at home.
